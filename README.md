# Codenames
#### (recreated) by Drake Wong

Using React and Python + Flask to recreate the board game _Codenames_.

>_Codenames_ is a 2015 card game for 4–8 players designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games. Two teams compete by each having a Spymaster give one word clues which can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team (Wikipedia).

This project was intended as a first foray into full-stack frameworks to learn the basics of app development. There are also a number of inconveniences in the physical version of _Codenames_ that can be addressed with the power of computing.
